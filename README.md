# FlutterApps
This repository contains the apps which I had developed while learning Flutter Framework
The apps is this repository may work slow on your devices because they are the development apks.
At that time I didn't knew how to export the apps and used to think the developmet apks were the final product.
Kindly check out my New Repository "A deeper dive into Flutter UI" for viewing my new flutter apps in this learning process.
